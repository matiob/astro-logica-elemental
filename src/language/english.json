    "aboutMe": "Many times I am asked if I believe in Astrology. My answer is that I believe in astrology as a tool of transformation just as a hammer is the tool to drive a nail. However, I try to remember that it is a super useful tool for me but it does not mean that it is the absolute truth, accepting that it is not for everyone and many people in all their right may think that it is silly. It is, for me , an energetic language that is based on the ancient knowledge of the 4 elements. Delving into the necessary balance between these four forces that order and sustain life has become the focus of my experience in recent years.",

    "tierra": "EARTH",
    "tierraTexto": "Earth energy is solid, concrete, stable, its rhythm is slow because it waits for organic time for things to take its course, it has the capacity for construction and perseverance. With the talent to work hard and with perseverance, understanding that the evolutionary process of things is what is important to reach the top, Earth naturally has a connection with everything that is stable, realistic and firm.",
    "tierraFrase": "body and matter",
    "agua": "WATER",
    "aguaTexto": "Aquatic energy tells us about sensitivity, emotions, the connection with our inner world. Perceive the intangible world. You can express emotions and feelings and have the quality of being able to live them and go through them. Sometimes the water feels like an internal tsunami and other times like lake water, beautiful and contemplative.",
    "aguaFrase": "emotionality", 
    "fuego": "FIRE",
    "fuegoTexto": "The energy of Fire is radiant, it shines, it gives heat, it is lit only with fuel, that is, desire. They are visible for their joie de vivre, quick and enthusiastic energy. This Element opens the doors to creativity and the creation of new ideas. Radiant in scope, this Element has an energy that influences creativity and new ideas, stimulating adventure and driving action.",
    "fuegoFrase": "spirit and intuition",
    "aire": "AIR",
    "aireTexto": "The energy of Air is free, light, it changes continuously, it is like the flow of the winds. The element AIR is the gaseous state, uncontainable and light, which expands and rises. The air is a carrier of information, it is the one that carries and brings content with information. You can see things in perspective and have an objective view of things.",

    "astroTexto": "The birth of a new being on this plane is perhaps the most intense and significant moment of life along with his death. Modern psychology has managed to connect past events with the present functioning of our psychological processes, these being the root of our behaviors and the way in which we relate to others and life. The birth chart gives us the opportunity to know the energetic roots of the personality that we, consciously or unconsciously, have built. From that starting point and through an almost constant self-observation, there is the beautiful possibility of beginning to choose with awareness the direction we want to give our life, where we want to put our energy, what we want to grow and no, what relationships to sustain, which ones to let go… It is worth clarifying that all these new freedoms come with new responsibilities, especially the responsibility for our emotional world. Let's say that everything or almost everything that happens inside us is our responsibility and no one else's. Blaming someone else or life doesn't help, or at least it hasn't helped me. The objective of Elemental Astro Logic is precisely to take the opportunity that the stars offer us to give a logical order to our psychological processes, relating them to Earth, Water, Fire and Air. Within that order, find balance, understanding and accepting as necessary our own chaos and the pain that comes from connecting in depth with the beautiful mystery that is life. From that joyful connection with our existence, the opportunities to build new realities that are aligned with what we are and what we want multiply. After all, Astrology is a tool to connect deeply with ourselves and gain energy. It will depend on us to create channels to give it direction and transform our reality. Hug",
