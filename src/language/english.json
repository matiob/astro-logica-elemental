    "aboutMe": "My name is Andres Buraschi, I was born in a small city in the center of the province of Santa Fe, Argentina. I come from a working middle class family in which affection and love were the pillars on which I was raised. I had a very intense, beautiful, turbulent and free childhood. Adolescence was the most painful and traumatic period of my life. The 'adult' world was where life cornered me until I had no choice but to look inward in search of a way out of the mental misery in which I lived. He had the life that many would have wanted but he no longer wanted to live, everything was meaningless. I found myself immersed in a society that is the servant of a perverse system based on fear, guilt and pride. I entered into a deep existential crisis which I had not allowed myself in the midst of the storm of adolescence, this time I had the advantage of being financially independent so, with the help of about 10 months of psychological therapy, I decided to sell everything and travel in search of transformation and liberation. I decided to go to Peru because of all the mysticism that surrounds Machu Picchu and the worldview of the Andean peoples. Through a group of people who dedicate their lives to sustaining and sharing ancestral practices of connection with being, I immersed myself in depth in the knowledge of the four elements and in myself. Due to all my rebellion, which had been so important to get out of the imposed order, it took me several years to chew this new natural order that I was finding. A couple of years ago I read a phrase by Jiddu Krishnamurti that said 'the paradox is that to be free you have to obey the natural order.' The 4 elements is, in my opinion, the energy archetype par excellence through which to observe our psychological processes with the aim of giving order and meaning to our lives, accepting that there are organic times that are beyond our control. From the beginning of the process I came across Astrology, an art based on the 4 elements, which I absorbed over the years until I made the decision to study it more in depth. As I incorporated language into my life experience, the need to share it gradually grew. If you think it's time to take responsibility for your inner world, for your life, Astrology and the knowledge about the 4 elements has a lot to offer you. Big hug",

    "astroTexto": "Many times I am asked if I believe in Astrology. My answer is that I believe in astrology as a tool of transformation just as a hammer is the tool to drive a nail. However, I try to remember that it is a super useful tool for me but it does not mean that it is the absolute truth, accepting that it is not for everyone and many people in all their right may think that it is silly. It is, for me , an energetic language that is based on the ancient knowledge of the 4 elements. Delving into the necessary balance between these four forces that order and sustain life has become the focus of my experience in recent years. The birth of a new being on this plane is perhaps the most intense and significant moment of life along with his death. Modern psychology has managed to connect past events with the present functioning of our psychological processes, these being the root of our behaviors and the way in which we relate to others and life. The birth chart gives us the opportunity to know the energetic roots of the personality that we, consciously or unconsciously, have built. From that starting point and through an almost constant self-observation, there is the beautiful possibility of beginning to choose with awareness the direction we want to give our life, where we want to put our energy, what we want to grow and no, what relationships to sustain, which ones to let go… It is worth clarifying that all these new freedoms come with new responsibilities, especially the responsibility for our emotional world. Let's say that everything or almost everything that happens inside us is our responsibility and no one else's. Blaming someone else or life doesn't help, or at least it hasn't helped me. The objective of Elemental Astro Logic is precisely to take the opportunity that the stars offer us to give a logical order to our psychological processes, relating them to Earth, Water, Fire and Air. Within that order, find balance, understanding and accepting as necessary our own chaos and the pain that comes from connecting in depth with the beautiful mystery that is life. From that joyful connection with our existence, the opportunities to build new realities that are aligned with what we are and what we want multiply. After all, Astrology is a tool to connect deeply with ourselves and gain energy. It will depend on us to create channels to give it direction and transform our reality. Hug",
